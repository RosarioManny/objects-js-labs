/*
Exercise 11
1. Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. Modify it so that it also decreases the number of pokeballs in your inventory each time you catch a PokÃ©mon.
2. How will you find and update the quantity of pokeballs in the `game.items` array?

Tips:
For this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.
After updating the method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.
Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.

Solve Exercise 11 here:

//   game.party.push(pokemonObj)
//   pokeBalls = pokeBalls - 1
// }

// console.log(pokeBalls)

/*
1. Similar to Exercise 6, now complete gyms with a difficulty below 6. How will you approach this?
 (change the value of `complete` in the qualifying objects from false to true). */
